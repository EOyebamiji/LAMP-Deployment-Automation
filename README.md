# Automating The Provisioning and Deployment of a LAMP Stack Deployment on Two (2) Ubuntu-Based Server

## Project Objective

+ Automate the provisioning of two Ubuntu-based servers, named "Master" and "Slave", using Vagrant.
+ On the Master node, create a bash script to automate the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
+ This script should clone a PHP application from GitHub, install all necessary packages, and configure Apache web server and MySQL. 
+ Ensure the bash script is reusable and readable.
+ Using an Ansible playbook:
    - Execute the bash script on the Slave node and verify that the PHP application is accessible through the VM's IP address (take screenshot of this as evidence)
    - Create a cron job to check the server's uptime every 12 am.


## Requirements for this project
- A strong internet connection
- Ubuntu-based host machine with Vagrant and VirtualBox installed.
- Basic knowledge of Vagrant, Bash scripting, Ansible, and LAMP stack components.
- A PHP (Laravel) application hosted on GitHub.
    - Official PHP Laravel GitHub Repository: https://github.com/laravel/laravel

## Prequisite Steps

1. Clone the repository 

Create a directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EOyebamiji/AltSchoolSecondSemesterProject.git
```

2. After cloning the repository, run the following commands:

```bash
cd AltSchoolSecondSemesterProject
vagrant up
```

This will execute the configuration defined in the Vagrantfile. The [Vagrantfile](/Vagrantfile) is set up to deploy two Ubuntu-based servers, "Master" and "Slave." The "Master" is provisioned with an execution script that automates the installation of the LAMP Stack and its dependencies. The [Vagrantfile](/Vagrantfile) [executes](/execute.sh) the [master script](/master.sh) to achieve this.

3. Access the Master Node:

On successful execution of the Vagrantfile, you'll see a welcome message similar to the one shown below:

![Success](assets/Successful%20execution%20of%20the%20Vagrantfile%20Master%20Script.png)

- The Laravel Application has been successfully deployed and hosted on the Master Node, accessible via the IP Address set by the Vagrantfile.

4. Access the Master and Slave Nodes:

Confirm access to the Master and Slave Nodes by executing the following commands:

```bash
vagrant ssh master
vagrant ssh slave
```
The above commands will grant access to the Master and Slave Nodes, respectively.

5.   SSH Key Setup:

To allow access to the Slave Node from the Master Node using Ansible, create an SSH key for the Master Node. On the Master Node, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo su #This is to switch to the root user
cd ~
ssh-keygen #Press Enter to all questions
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub #This will display the generated ssh key
```

Next, open a new CLI (such as Git Bash) and SSH into the Slave Node:

```bash
vagrant ssh slave
```

Switch to the root user and save the generated SSH key from the Master Node:

```bash
sudo su
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys #This will open the authorized_keys for this node, save the copied ssh key into it and save
```
![ssh](assets/save%20ssh%20slave.png)

Test the connection from the Master Node to the Slave Node to ensure it's reachable via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@iP_Address
```
![ssh](assets/successful%20ssh%20to%20slave%20node.png)

6. Run Ansible Playbook:

To deploy the configuration of the Slave Node from the Master Node using Ansible, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo su # Switch to the root user
cd /vagrant # Change to the /vagrant directory containing the Ansible playbook and other files
cd Ansible/ # Change to the Ansible directory and initiate the playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml # Deploy the Ansible script to configure the Slave Node and deploy the LAMP Stack
```

![Ansible](assets/Successful%20execution%20of%20ansible%20playbook.png)

After successful execution of the Ansible Playbook and the deployment of the LAMP stack on the Slave Node, the Laravel application is reachable from the Slave Node's IP Address.

This marks the end of the deployment, successfully automating the provisioning and configuration of two Ubuntu-based servers using Vagrant, bash scripts, and Ansible.
